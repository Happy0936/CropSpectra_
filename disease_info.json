      "Numerous small circular spots on lower leaves with dark borders and gray centers",
      "Yellowing of infected leaves and progressive defoliation",
      "Reduced plant vigor and yield when severe"

    "treatment": [
      "Use miticides registered for spider mite control following label instructions.",
      "Apply horticultural oils or insecticidal soaps, targeting undersides of leaves.",
      "Introduce or conserve natural predators (Phytoseiulus, Neoseiulus) where feasible."

    "prevention": [
      "Maintain adequate irrigation and humidity (mites thrive in hot, dry conditions).",
